= Animating Source Code

There are two ways to animate source-code in CuP.
Both display the same result on screen but the method to achieve that result is very different.

- Use *inline markers* if you want to display a *few* (or no) animations.
- Use the *external editor* if you want to display multiple *complex* animations.
