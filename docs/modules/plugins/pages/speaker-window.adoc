= Plugin: Speaker Window
:experimental:

image:speaker-window.png[]

The speaker window allows you to control the presentation and:

* See the current slide & step being displayed (big left slide).
* See the next slide & step that will be displayed next step forward (small right slide).
* See previously prepared speaker notes.
* Draw over the slide or highlight a portion of it.
* See a timer to ensure you're on time.


[[install]]
== Installing

First, add the plugin dependency to your project:

[tabs]
====
CuP Plugin::
+
.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
kotlin {
    sourceSets.commonMain.dependencies {
        implementation(cup.plugin.speakerWindow)
    }
}
----

Regular Gradle::
+
.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin, subs="attributes"]
----
kotlin {
    sourceSets.commonMain.dependencies {
        implementation("net.kodein.cup:cup-speaker-window:{version}")
    }
}
----
====

Then, in your presentation configuration, add the Speaker Window plugin:

[source, kotlin]
----
Presentation(
    slides = presentationSlides,
    configuration = {
        speakerWindow()
    }
)
----


[[usage]]
== Using to present

To open the speaker window: tap kbd:[S] or click on the image:icon/speaker_notes.svg[] icon in the top left overlay bar of your presentation.

Within this speaker window, you can control the navigation of your presentation with the xref:core:app-desktop.adoc#navigation[same keys as with the desktop app].


[[notes]]
== Writing speaker notes

To attach speaker notes to a slide, add it its xref:core:slide.adoc#user-data[user data]:

[source, kotlin]
----
val mySlide by Slide(
    user = SpeakerNotes {
        Text("Some speaker notes")
    }
) {
    /* slide content */
}
----

For ease of writing, CuP provides the ability to write speaker notes in MarkDown with `SpeakerNotesMD`:

[source, kotlin]
----
val mySlide by Slide(
    user = SpeakerNotesMD("""
        This slides has some **speaker notes** that you can see here!

        - You can use markdown in speaker notes
        - Or you can use regular compose if you prefer

        Isn't that cool!
    """)
) {
    /* slide content */
}
----


[[highlight]]
== Drawing & Highlighting

CuP provides two tools that are visible when the mouse hovers the big current slide in the speaker window:

image:speaker-window-with-tools.png[]

* The image:icon/draw.svg[] tool allows you to display a red pointer to the screen, and to free draw in bright red over your slide.
* The image:icon/rectangle.svg[] tool allows you to isolate, and therefore highlight, portions of your screens.

To stop using these tools, once you have selected one, click on the image:icon/close.svg[] button that appears in their place.
